# Snake Game

Game of Snake written in Python 3 with the help of pygame library.

### Short description
This is my version of the legendary game, which I first encountered on a Nokia phone. The game features a snake,whose tail increases each time when a fruit is eaten. After every 5 pieces were eaten, speed is increased and one more enemy is spawned. If a player bites its own tail or crashes into one of the enemies, game over.

### Libraries needed
* pygame
* Pillow (Python Image Library)
